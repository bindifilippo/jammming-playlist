This project is a practical exercise to learn how to use React, Vite, and the Spotify API.
The app allows you to:
	•	search for songs using Spotify
	•	create a custom playlist
	•	save the playlist to your Spotify account

The main goal is to practice:
	•	React components
	•	state management
	•	fetching data from external APIs
